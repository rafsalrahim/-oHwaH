Installation

Deno ships as a single executable with no dependencies. You can install it using the installers below, or download a release binary from the releases page.

Using Shell (macOS, Linux):

curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh

Using PowerShell (Windows):

iwr https://deno.land/x/install/install.ps1 -useb | iex

Using Cargo (Windows, macOS, Linux):

cargo install deno

Using Homebrew (macOS):

brew install deno

Using Chocolatey (Windows):

choco install deno

Using Scoop (Windows):

scoop install deno

Because Deno requires the use of file extensions for module imports and allows http imports, and most editors and language servers do not natively support this at the moment, many editors will throw errors about being unable to find files or imports having unnecessary file extensions.
